A very basic flight sim. I couldn't really figure out how to implement proper flight controls and physics, so it feels more like a hovercraft or a UFO. The player will always move in the direction you face to sort of simulate an engine thrusting you forwards. Ascending and descending can be done at will.

You win by shooting down all of the enemy planes, and lose by crashing into anything (the ground or enemy planes).

The game takes a bit of time to load because of the plane models. Waiting for several seconds during the load screen is pretty normal.
